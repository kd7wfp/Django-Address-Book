Django Address Book
This is my very simple implementation of a django address book.
I used the built in administrative tools and views. I used sqlite
and have a db table called contacts. The administrative user below
has the ability to fully manage the contacts.

To start the application:
1. python manage.py runserver

Administrative User:
admin -> password

Endpoints to interact with:
/ .............. redirect to the login page
/AddressBook ... ReadMe.md
/admin ......... login page
